Project MVP

Database:
- 2 tables (Discography, Newsletter email addresses)
- Connects to server

Server:
- Handles requests (Sends user email to database)
- Sends response (Notifies user when their email is successfully added to mailing list)

Front End:
- 3-5 interactive features (Image slider, header w/ links, footer w/ links)
- 5 components (Header, footer, newsletter entry, photo gallery, button component)
- Custom styling
- Communicates with server
- Tables contain data (Users that have signed up for newsletter)

Ended up changing the MVP quite a bit but I believe I hit at least 9 checkpoints! Here's what I got:

Database:
- Tables contain data
- Connects to server

Server:
- Handles Requests
- Sends response

Front End:
- 3-5 interactive features (image slider, newsletter signup, footer with links to social media/music)
- 5 components (Header, footer, title, photo carousel, newsletter signup)
- Custom styling
- Communicates with server
- Stores values on state
